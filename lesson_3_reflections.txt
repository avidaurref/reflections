When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I would want to share my work, and work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's better pull changes manually because you can control your version 
    per a logical change

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are similar to clones, difference is that forks only work on GitHub.
    Clones and Branches both work in a Git System. Clones copy a repository
    instead branches labeled a commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that you can solve any merging problem fastly because
    you can anticipate if edition can cause conflict.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It will be hard to collaborate without using Git or GitHub because
    you wouldn't be able to see all changes. It is easier to make a mistake
    when you don't have a system. It will be easier in order to make decisions
    faster because you are not punished to follow a process.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would make changes in a separate branch only in my computer. It's better working 
    on master branch when you are working with another people because you can review how 
    your changes will affect the project and anticipate any conflict of merging.
